# Loan-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties. In this project, I build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the lending company or not. We will prepare the data using Spyder IDE and use various models to predict the target variable. Data For this problem, we have three CSV files: train, test, and sample submission. Train file will be used for training the model, i.e. our model will learn from this file. It contains all the independent variables and the target variable. Test file contains all the independent variables, but not the target variable. We will apply the model to predict the target variable for the test data.
